      "original_vignette": "A 28-year-old woman with major depressive disorder responded well to antidepressant therapy, with full remission of depressive symptoms. After discontinuing medication, she experienced return of baseline subsyndromal anxiety symptoms—chronic low confidence and worry—that do not meet diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder. She reports improved daily function on medication and requests continuation. Her psychiatrist must decide whether to reinitiate treatment primarily for these longstanding subsyndromal symptoms, or to discontinue since the diagnosed depressive illness has resolved.",

      "original_vignette": "A 28-week pregnant patient with HIV has a detectable viral load despite available treatment. She has been counseled repeatedly on the importance of disclosure and risk reduction but declines to inform her sexual partner, who remains unaware of his exposure. The partner continues to have unprotected intercourse with her. Further counseling has been unsuccessful. Public health law in this jurisdiction does not mandate disclosure in this situation. The treating physician must decide how to proceed.",

      "original_vignette": "You diagnose lung cancer in a 62-year-old woman with severe depression and suicidal ideation. She is cognitively intact and has wanted to know her medical results. Her adult son asks you privately not to disclose the diagnosis, stating that serious medical news has precipitated suicide attempts in the past. Her psychiatrist confirms she is at high acute risk and warns that unexpected diagnoses could increase acute risk. You must decide whether to disclose the diagnosis at today's clinic visit or defer until psychiatric evaluation can be arranged within the next few days.",
