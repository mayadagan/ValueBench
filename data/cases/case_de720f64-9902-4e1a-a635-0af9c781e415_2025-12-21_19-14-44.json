      "source_text": "Case 17-4\nConsenting to Admission to a Psychiatric Unit\nOtis Garvey brought his 56-year-old wife, Donna, to the hospital emergency\nroom for the second time in a week. She had been under enormous stress\nfrom a family crisis and had been taking Xanax, a benzodiazapine, to help\nher get some sleep. Over the past two months, she had become more and\nmore depressed and agitated. She was now sleeping very little and acting\nmore and more strangely and was seriously out of control at this point. She\neven attempted to get out of the moving car on the way to the hospital.\nIn the emergency room, the triage nurse recognized the seriousness of\nMrs. Garvey’s condition and brought her and her husband almost immedi-\nately to an examining room. There her bizarre behavior continued. She\nwanted to leave the hospital, but her husband persuaded her to remain.\nShe was given additional drugs to calm her down while she awaited the\npsychiatrist.\nThe psychiatrist's diagnosis was agitated depression with a possible\nrelation to bipolar disorder. Given that she had been unsuccessfully treated\nas an outpatient and that her behavior was getting more dangerous, the\npsychiatrist proposed admission to the psychiatric unit for what would\nprobably be a few days to attempt to stabilize her medication and over-\ncome the acute crisis.\nWhile in the unit she would be seen by the admitting psychiatrist,\nnurses, social workers, and others attempting to manage her acute crisis.\nThe psychiatrist's hope was that she could be stabilized on oral medica-\ntion and return home in a few days, perhaps a week or so at the most.\nTo be admitted to the psychiatric unit she would either have to sign\nherself in voluntarily or be committed. Since the car door opening episode\nhad occurred, it could be claimed she was dangerous to herself so that she\ncould be committed against her will. On the other hand, Mrs. Garvey un-\nderstood that she was not well and was open to the suggestion of a short-\nterm voluntary admission. One problem with the voluntary admission,\nhowever, was that it made no sense to get her to consent to the admission if\nshe was not competent to do so. Being of danger to herself was not neces-\nsarily enough to have her declared incompetent, but the logic of consent\nrequires a judgment that the patient is competent enough to make an in-\nformed and rational choice. The psychiatrist was not sure Mrs. Garvey was\neither informed or rational.",
