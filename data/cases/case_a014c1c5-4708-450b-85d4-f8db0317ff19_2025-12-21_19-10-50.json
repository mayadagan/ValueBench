      "source_text": "Case 11-5\nEmbryo Biopsy\nIt was only a few months after an IVF procedure was approved at Midwest\nMedical Center that a proposal was presented to the Ethics Committee for\ndiscussion and approval of a new procedure that would expand on IVF.\nThe procedure, referred to as embryo biopsy, allows for PGD for simple\ngene defects such as Huntington disease and cystic fibrosis (CF) in em-\nbryos. For couples who have had a CF child in the past and are worried\nabout having another, physicians could offer standard IVF protocol with\nthe following additional steps: the sample used to infer genetic composi-\ntion includes polar bodies removed on day one after fertilization and one or\ntwo blastomeres on day three of cleavage-stage embryo development (the\nsix- to eight-cell stage). The embryos that do not have the defect would be\nimplanted in the mother’s womb, ensuring that their child or children would\nnot have the gene nor be able to pass the gene on to their children.\nDr. Thomas Sobeira, a member of the ethics committee, had deep con-\ncerns about this proposal for “embryo biopsy.” He was concerned about how\naccurate the test was and the potential for misdiagnosis. Even though the\nprevention of CF seemed an admirable goal, he was also concerned about\nopening the door to separating fetuses we wish to develop from those we\nwish to discontinue. In addition, a child with CF is not doomed to death in\n- infancy. In 2009, the median predicted age of survival for CF patients was in\nthe mid-30s, and there is no intellectual or behavioral impairment. Gene\ntherapy offers great promise for treatment. In the meantime, however, the\nchild is likely to be chronically ill and require repeated hospitalizations.",
