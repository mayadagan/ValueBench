She fell over on AstroTurf in the afternoon the day before while playing hockey\nand grazed her knees. Her left knee is now extremely painful, swollen and erythematous, and\nshe cannot bend her leg or weight bear. You suspect that she has a septic arthritis secondary to\nher knee injury. This is a medical emergency, and without immediate drainage and antibiotic\ntreatment there is a risk of destructive joint damage and permanent disability. You explain to\nCordelia that she needs to have the joint aspirated and the risks associated with aspiration.\nYou are not sure that she is taking in what you are telling her because she is in pain and very\nscared.\nQuestions\n• Is the patient competent to make such a decision?\n• How is this assessment made?\n• Who makes this assessment?",

The patient appears frightened and has difficulty focusing during the explanation of the procedure and its risks.
