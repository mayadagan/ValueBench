She is alert and wishes to remain so to spend meaningful time with her family. The pain team proposes a neurolytic celiac plexus block, which could provide significant pain relief and reduce opioid requirements. However, the procedure carries risk of serious complications including paraplegia, visceral injury, and hypotension. The patient understands the risks but is desperate for relief.
