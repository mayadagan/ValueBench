He has\nhad a recent inpatient stay with abdominal pain and has come for the results of some further\ninvestigations he has had as an outpatient. No cause for his pain was found at the time and\nit has not returned. The consultant is also able to reassure the child and his mother that all\nthe other tests have been normal too. The consultant then goes on to bring up the thorny\nsubject of the child’s weight. Although his mother is very slender, it is obvious that Daniel is\nobese. Unfortunately, at the mere mention of his weight, Daniel becomes tearful, and as the\nconsultant pushes on to discuss it further, he gets very distressed and leaves the room.\nQuestions\n• Should the consultant have raised this subject?\n• Would it have made a difference if the consultation was with an adult?\n• What other lifestyle choices should healthcare professionals discuss with their\npatients?",
