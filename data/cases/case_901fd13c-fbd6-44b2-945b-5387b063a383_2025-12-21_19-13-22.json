He had been on that same road just prior to\nthe explosion. He deeply grieved their deaths; subsequently, he spoke with\nan Army psychologist about his “survivor guilt.”\nHe returned to the United States and to his previous job. Ironically,\nwithin six months he was involved in a car accident in which the other driver\nwas killed. Then he developed frequent flashbacks to his war losses,\naffecting his ability to concentrate. While under therapy with a psychiatrist,\nLucille Bell, he heard from a friend that Eye Movement Desensitization and\nReprocessing (EMDR) treatment had been used successfully in such cases.\nHowever, when he sought treatment from Dr. Bell, he learned that his insur-\nance company considered his problem as a “preexisting condition” and\ndenied coverage.",
