A 21-year-old woman with anorexia nervosa (BMI 18.1) is admitted for bradycardia with low heart rate and orthostatic hypotension, where her blood pressure drops when she stands up. She is currently eating only about 25% of her meals and refuses oral nutritional supplements. Her labs show low electrolytes: phosphate 2.2 mg/dL, magnesium 1.2 mg/dL, and potassium 3.0 mEq/L. Her QTc interval is normal at 420 ms, which means her heart rhythm is stable. Her abdomen is distended with absent bowel sounds and she has had two episodes of vomiting today. She agrees to "try harder tomorrow," but her food intake has not improved over 24 hours. On interview, she is judged to have decision-making capacity and repeats back that her malnutrition and electrolyte abnormalities put her at risk for arrhythmias and further clinical deterioration, yet she continues to refuse tube feeding. Her weight has been stable since admission. Her vitals are notable for severe bradycardia and low blood pressure: HR 38-46, BP 88/54, Sp02 98%. One option is to initiate enteral nutrition, providing calories with a nasogastric feeding tube. Initiating nasogastric enteral nutrition is likely to restore caloric intake and correct electrolytes over the next several days, improving her bradycardia/orthostatic hypotension and reducing the risk of life-threatening complications. Another option is to continue monitoring, which avoids risks of aspiration and respiratory issues.
Decisions:
Decision 1: Initiate enteral nutrition with a nasogastric feeding tube
